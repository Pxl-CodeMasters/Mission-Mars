                -By the year 2020, It has been evident that Earth will not be a
                favorable long-term home. NASA predicts that by 2050 Earth will
                be just too 'full' & there won't be any more land for growing
                crops or doing almost anything that is possible today.... It is
                obvious that we would some day or the other have to migrate from
                Earth and start living life on another planet....

              <p>
                But the big question is where? Where do we have enough oxygen?
                Where do we have enough water? Which is the closest planet we
                could colonize? The most popular answer is either Mars or our
                satellite Moon... But which one is more preferable? The Moon has
                some serious advantages over Mars, and Mars has some serious
                advantages over the Moon. Obviously the Moon is much more closer
                to the Earth and so shipping things from the Earth would be much
                more cheaper. But Mars is much better for a 'long-term habitat'.
                It would definitely be more expensive and slower to colonize
                mars and lead a normal Earth-like life....

                By now, people were fascinated by the idea of colonizing another

                astonished by this idea and took his own steps into making this
                a reality. He & his team at SpaceX started to design a rocket
                that would take colonists & supplies to mars. He named this
                rocket 'Starship'. This same year Russian space agency Roscosmos
                successfully sent a probe into the orbit of Mars. Well
                scientists discovered that Mars surface wasn't really suitable
                for human life. Humans can't live on Mars without space
                suits....

                aim of this prototype was to fly Starhopper to about 500 feet
                altitude. The company built the enormous rocket to achieve its
                goal of transporting up to 100 people in the space flights.
                SpaceX begins to build more prototypes aiming to send the first

                a high-altitude test flight & landing of their latest Starship

                surface from orbit using its 5 science instruments. While, Japan

                Mars' moon Phobos and send them back to Earth for further
                studying. But SpaceX is much more ahead in the run, the Starship
                prototype is now ready and operating crewed test flights. The

                The #dearmoon mission will take its crew on an orbit around the

                complete. This small space station will orbit the Moon and be

                The biggest test is now here, SpaceX has finally finished with
                their spaceship. The ship has been tested, but this is going to
                be its longest trip yet. Hence, they decided to make their first
                mission to Mars, unmanned. The two cargo Starships will be
                heading to Mars, they both are going to be loaded with a mini
                nuclear power reactor, and a few other devices to create Oxygen
                & Methane from the Martian atmosphere which would make life
                possible. This is around the same time when NASA will be
                retrieving samples from Mars & transport it back to the Earth.
                This is apparently also the same year in which SpaceX plans to
                send humans to the Moon to search for frozen water in its polar
                regions....

                permanent accomodation on the Moon. While all this is going on,

              <h2>The Foundation</h2>
              <p>
                Well Mars is about to get populated but there still many humans
                in the newest missions. Two unmanned Starships arrive on the
                future site of Mars Base Alpha, and toss out a fleet of rovers,
                solar panels & mining robots that will build the foundation of
                the base. It'll be one of the biggest construction projects in
                the history of mankind. It would approximately take more than
                year to complete....

                The robots are doing a great job, as landing fields are now
                cleared and the base continues to be prepared. But while all
                this 'architecture' work is going on, the Moon is about to
                become alot more crowded. Artemis Base Camp was completed
                recently. And after a few tests, it is ready to welcome its
                first residents. Just like the ISS (International Space Station)
                this base will allow its residents to conduct long term study of
                the Moon....

                "We've come along way, now the entire world is watching us" Elon
                Musk said. SpaceX has recruited 24 lucky individuals to become
                the crew members of the first manned mission to Mars. The crew
                will be divided into groups of twelve, and sent on a pair of
                Starships followed by cargo ships. While this is primarily a
                SpaceX mission, they are backed up by NASA and will be watched
                by everyone around the globe. The cargo ships are crucial for
                this mission as they will be carrying a ISRU. This machine will
                be used to collect, proccess, store, and use the materials found
                on Mars to replace construction supplies and propellants that
                would otherwise need to be taken and carried from the Earth....

                Solar panels are also being constructed around the planet by
                robots, providing much of the power Mars Base Alpha will be
                using. SpaceX also deploys its Starlink satellites around Mars,
                guaranteeing communication and GPS abilities on this new
                horizon. Well, certainly no one would want to get lost in the
                new planet. 'But would it work?' that's the question everyone
                wants to know. SpaceX estimates the trip to Mars will still take
                a few months but it will be faster than the NASA voyages. After
                a few years, the Starships touch down on Mars. The whole world

              <p>
                Now the hard work begins, the 24 residents of the Mars Base
                Alpha are living in a self-contained environment, in an
                artificial atmosphere, and only travel outside the base for
                research missions under controlled situations in space suits
                that are designed to withstand the harsh conditions outside. The
                robots have been scouting for the presence of frozen water for
                years and once the best location has been found out, it'll be
                mined and processed into drinkable water. The construction
                robots are still at hard work - building more landing and launch
                pads for future Starships....
